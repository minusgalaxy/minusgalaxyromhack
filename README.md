<h3>For tilesets:</h3>
<img src="http://bin.smwcentral.net/u/27050/chrbank.png"/><p>This is the amount of pixel space per chr bank, you are allowed 2 of these per level theme. I would reccomend storing the tileset on one and scenery (bushes, fences, and so on) in the other. Each 8x8 tile can be a different palette.<br/>
<b>Level Themes:</b><br/>
Grassland<br/>
Desert/Beach<br/>
Chocolate (Mountain)<br/>
City/Industrial<br/>
Space<br/>
Ice<br/>
Cave<br/>
Water<br/>
Sky<br/>
Castle<br/>
Ghost House<br/>
Bonus/Switch Palace<br/>
Yoshi's House<br/>
Town<br/>
</p>
<h3>For Sprites:</h3>
<p>Since sprites in SMW are a bit fucky with tilemaps and palettes (read: really fucky) if you want to do a sprite just ask and I (Diantha) will give you all the info you need.</p>
<h3>For Blocks:</h3>
Blocks use the global palette seen above.

<h1>For Testers:</h1>
<p><b>Please, do not use ZSNES for playing this game for testing purposes. It is your prerogative to have a worse experience for gameplay, but higan is a cycle-accurate emulator of the Super Famicom/Super Nintendo Entertainment System. You can download it here: https://byuu.org/emulation/higan/</b></p>
It would be great if testers could capture and zip up a 1x video of their gameplay for analysis of bugs, and if you're also going to be critiquing, then adding that as a text piece or audio track would be nice. Stir is going to be providing a video captured and audio discussed play-through of every level, but we definitely want people to at least provide the following info when talking about level critique:<br/>
<b>Level Name<br/>
Emulator Used [with Version]<br/>
Perceived Difficulty<br/>
Comments and Critiques </b>[Thematic Fit, Appropriate Placement of Difficulty, Non-obvious or Obtuse Solution, Glitch Reptitiveness, etc . . . .]
